TO DO:

Continue flow with job number 55.


so i have archiving for job numbers, this is everything links to a job is archived and saved as read only intead of full functions. how can i save all of the data within the tables 


CHECK LAST CHANGES FIRST
create a flow for create a job card, start from the /create page and then based on the code used create a story line with "bla bla bla > bla bla bla" like actions to show next page / feaute/ tap/ section. use a code to show which sections are linked to what eg showing the same infomation where else that feaute is used etc. add the databazse table used and if the table can be made better save the data add the database table name and columns withn the story line. have the story line more like bullet points created in a new folder under docs which will be named Jobcard Flow. 








VIDEO UPDATE WHEN WORKING
Add overlay to the video which is like a bubble which goes to a fix location within the recording which the user can press during the recording Like ar tiles which give the title an colour of the issue. have it so it alwyas show the front pads and discs measurenmetns as well as all 4 tyres no matter red amber or green. with the ohter conerns always show either red or amber. never green. 




TO BE COMPLETED AT END:

Go through the status of each section and job to make sure status is good and matchs and works well within the database. 




With every page within the top bar to the right of the search add a "?" button which opens a drop down (link to drop down style api) which shows (contact support (this opens messages tab and starts a new message with the uers Lead tech (add this in small print within the section as a todo) which within the text box to send the message shows a / comand which tells the sender the page the user was on and then the user can then input text after either reporting a concern, bug, or a question. The next in the drop down is a "Tutorial" button which gives multiple steps describing what each section and button does inside an overlay type style making the background darker and the section or button the tutorial is telling how to use lighter with the description box like a bubble which is inside the darker section and the bubble is following the light and dark theme, there is also a "Next" and "back" button which flicks through the each section and button to do with that page/the tab selected at the time of the button press with also an "Finish" button which closes the overlay and tutorial section. What woul dbe the best way to implement this? as an api with a file linked to each page and tab which has all of the buttons and section anmes and descriptions inside the api linking or a section within the actual code which reads the code and sees what section does what same with buttons, unless theres another way which is commonly used for tutorials like im describing.

NOTE:


See if database strucure links to all of the code with the src/lib/database/schema/schemaReference.sql also see if any tables are in the src/lib/database/schema/schemaReference.sql and are not being used inside the code and why they arent being used. Make sure that all of the code and inputes saves to the database where required and in the corrected locations add any tables/columns to src/lib/database/schema/addtable.sql



Add any database tables / columns to file location: src/lib/database/schema/addtable.sql, can to see if the table is already inside the file location: src/lib/database/schema/schemaReference.sql file first
