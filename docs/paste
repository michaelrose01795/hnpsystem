TO DO:

Continue flow with job number 55


CHECK
with the "Upload Documents" popup, does the document actually get uploaded to the database? if not what happens and is it a perminent thing, have it so the "Upload Documents" popup shows all of the uploaded items always when something has been uplaoded. 


FIND OUT
Can we add an auto detect text box locations, tick box location, signature box location, correct orientation, so the app can turn the uploaded document into a live seach which can be ticked, signed, reg field etc auto filled out. or is this not possible. 


DO THISSSS
work on implementing "AI" within whole app search chat "AI job detection system"




checkkkkk
have it so the print button only gets the section of the invoice tab within the print, make it so the print format is vertial and everything fits within the vertical page, have it all within a nice layout. as well add an emial button, when clicked this button will find the customer email, and authomaticlly attach the print copy into the emial and send automaticlly. 



make sure the "ALLOCATE PARTS" part section always shows the customer request (at the top) and VHC request (blow the cusomter request) at all times if its been reported, new remove the requests from that sectin even if a part has been allocated to that request.




Fix it so when i click allocated with an authoirse request it works the same with a normal request. 


Within write up and VHC tab inside the tab section, when the VHC is fully complete (Everything is authorised or delcined) change the background colour to green, and when everything is ticked within the write up section change the write up tab button background to green as well. so the part moves to on job to within the row of the request its been allocated to, link this though the database as well. 

CHECK
Sub-job number, make sure database table update and is all linked. 

add the changes to the database into the addtables.sql for me to put into the table editor. 



fix the "Job Type" column within the appointment page within the "Jobs for" section so it shows the correct job detection, have it so it shows all of them within the column, if more than two rows then create a scroll within the column for that row if goes more. 


CHECKKKK
have it so when in smaller screen than the full windows and full ipad size the sidebar open button and status open button are only shown at the top of the page in a 50/50 tab button style layout. add a close button on the "My Dashboard" row. 

CHECKKK
have it so the top bar doesnt show anythe mode or Welcome back section when in this modesand have it so the search bar isnt insdie the top bar its underneath the navigator and status button taking up the whole width. 




Go though each page and set which section has what level of colour level 1-4,  
Change to base layer " /* Level 3 (Bottom layer - pale red): page background + outer shell */
  --layer-section-level-3: #ffeaea;" adjust in all places where users 





TO BE COMPLETED AT END:

Go through the status of each section and job to make sure status is good and matchs and works well within the database. 




With every page within the top bar to the right of the search add a "?" button which opens a drop down (link to drop down style api) which shows (contact support (this opens messages tab and starts a new message with the uers Lead tech (add this in small print within the section as a todo) which within the text box to send the message shows a / comand which tells the sender the page the user was on and then the user can then input text after either reporting a concern, bug, or a question. The next in the drop down is a "Tutorial" button which gives multiple steps describing what each section and button does inside an overlay type style making the background darker and the section or button the tutorial is telling how to use lighter with the description box like a bubble which is inside the darker section and the bubble is following the light and dark theme, there is also a "Next" and "back" button which flicks through the each section and button to do with that page/the tab selected at the time of the button press with also an "Finish" button which closes the overlay and tutorial section. What woul dbe the best way to implement this? as an api with a file linked to each page and tab which has all of the buttons and section anmes and descriptions inside the api linking or a section within the actual code which reads the code and sees what section does what same with buttons, unless theres another way which is commonly used for tutorials like im describing.

NOTE:


See if database strucure links to all of the code with the src/lib/database/schema/schemaReference.sql also see if any tables are in the src/lib/database/schema/schemaReference.sql and are not being used inside the code and why they arent being used. Make sure that all of the code and inputes saves to the database where required and in the corrected locations add any tables/columns to src/lib/database/schema/addtable.sql



Add any database tables / columns to file location: src/lib/database/schema/addtable.sql, can to see if the table is already inside the file location: src/lib/database/schema/schemaReference.sql file first
