TO DO:

Continue flow with job number 54


CHECKKKKKK
Book a goods‑in item to a job via the popup and confirm the catalog entry exists with qty_in_stock = 0.
Complete a goods‑in record with mixed booked/not‑booked items and confirm only the not‑booked parts increase stock.


Check 
have iut so the Retaail price and cost price use the £30 sum when the "Franchise" dropdown "Tyres" is selected, if other are selected then do not apply the £30 difference and make it so "Retail price " and "Cost price " are indiviual. Have it so within the "Add goods-in parts to a job " popup it shoes show "Select one job and the parts to add. Part number, description, and quantity will be sent to the job." text nad better layed out and all sections follows the light and dark theme

 



CHECKK??
Have it so any check in, in progress, etc (or status apart from booked and inoviced and comlete) that if a job is assinged to a tech user then it shows within that the users card inside the "job-cards/waiting/nextjobs" page. make sure that the jobs within the todays workflow tab and carry over tab if a tech is assinged that job then it shows within that section until the assingment is unassinged or the assingment is swapped to another tech user. 


CHECKKKKKKKKKKK
When the "Complete" button is pressed and the popup opnes and "Not now" is pressed take the user back to the "parts/goods-in" page with all of the data cleared from the fields. when "Add to job" button is pressed the next popup shows the "Part number" and "Pirelli P Zero, 235/40 R18 95Y XL" with quantity wanting to add to the job with job number, 1 or multiple rows of the parts can be selected to add to the job number at once, after 1 or all of the parts are added (doesnt matter how many) the cancel button which takes the user back to the "Goods in complete" popup is pressed or the finish button is pressed which saves the changes to the database, any parts which we not added to a job number we added to the stock catalog and the user is taken back to the "parts/goods-in" page with the fields empty. 


CHECKKKKKKKKK
When search in global for "goods in number" have it so it opens the page "/parts/goods-in/[GINnumber]" not "/parts/goods-in?goodsIn=GIN[number], this will take the users to a new page, inside this page build a invoice recreation with Supplier details at the top section, invoice lines in the middle, totals at the bottom, history section for where the parts were added once goods in was complete either to a job number or to stock, if to job number how many what invocie line and how many and the same with stock. 




Go though each page and set which section has what level of colour level 1-4,  
Change to base layer " /* Level 3 (Bottom layer - pale red): page background + outer shell */
  --layer-section-level-3: #ffeaea;" adjust in all places where users 





TO BE COMPLETED AT END:

Go through the status of each section and job to make sure status is good and matchs and works well within the database. 




With every page within the top bar to the right of the search add a "?" button which opens a drop down (link to drop down style api) which shows (contact support (this opens messages tab and starts a new message with the uers Lead tech (add this in small print within the section as a todo) which within the text box to send the message shows a / comand which tells the sender the page the user was on and then the user can then input text after either reporting a concern, bug, or a question. The next in the drop down is a "Tutorial" button which gives multiple steps describing what each section and button does inside an overlay type style making the background darker and the section or button the tutorial is telling how to use lighter with the description box like a bubble which is inside the darker section and the bubble is following the light and dark theme, there is also a "Next" and "back" button which flicks through the each section and button to do with that page/the tab selected at the time of the button press with also an "Finish" button which closes the overlay and tutorial section. What woul dbe the best way to implement this? as an api with a file linked to each page and tab which has all of the buttons and section anmes and descriptions inside the api linking or a section within the actual code which reads the code and sees what section does what same with buttons, unless theres another way which is commonly used for tutorials like im describing.

NOTE:


See if database strucure links to all of the code with the src/lib/database/schema/schemaReference.sql also see if any tables are in the src/lib/database/schema/schemaReference.sql and are not being used inside the code and why they arent being used. Make sure that all of the code and inputes saves to the database where required and in the corrected locations add any tables/columns to src/lib/database/schema/addtable.sql



Add any database tables / columns to file location: src/lib/database/schema/addtable.sql, can to see if the table is already inside the file location: src/lib/database/schema/schemaReference.sql file first
