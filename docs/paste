TO DO:

Continue flow with job number 54


CHECK
Sub-job number, make sure database table update and is all linked. 

add the changes to the database into the addtables.sql for me to put into the table editor. 



CHECKKKK
have it so when in smaller screen than the full windows and full ipad size the sidebar open button and status open button are only shown at the top of the page in a 50/50 tab button style layout. add a close button on the "My Dashboard" row. 

CHECKKK
have it so the top bar doesnt show anythe mode or Welcome back section when in this modesand have it so the search bar isnt insdie the top bar its underneath the navigator and status button taking up the whole width. 



Go though each page and set which section has what level of colour level 1-4,  
Change to base layer " /* Level 3 (Bottom layer - pale red): page background + outer shell */
  --layer-section-level-3: #ffeaea;" adjust in all places where users 





TO BE COMPLETED AT END:

Go through the status of each section and job to make sure status is good and matchs and works well within the database. 




With every page within the top bar to the right of the search add a "?" button which opens a drop down (link to drop down style api) which shows (contact support (this opens messages tab and starts a new message with the uers Lead tech (add this in small print within the section as a todo) which within the text box to send the message shows a / comand which tells the sender the page the user was on and then the user can then input text after either reporting a concern, bug, or a question. The next in the drop down is a "Tutorial" button which gives multiple steps describing what each section and button does inside an overlay type style making the background darker and the section or button the tutorial is telling how to use lighter with the description box like a bubble which is inside the darker section and the bubble is following the light and dark theme, there is also a "Next" and "back" button which flicks through the each section and button to do with that page/the tab selected at the time of the button press with also an "Finish" button which closes the overlay and tutorial section. What woul dbe the best way to implement this? as an api with a file linked to each page and tab which has all of the buttons and section anmes and descriptions inside the api linking or a section within the actual code which reads the code and sees what section does what same with buttons, unless theres another way which is commonly used for tutorials like im describing.

NOTE:


See if database strucure links to all of the code with the src/lib/database/schema/schemaReference.sql also see if any tables are in the src/lib/database/schema/schemaReference.sql and are not being used inside the code and why they arent being used. Make sure that all of the code and inputes saves to the database where required and in the corrected locations add any tables/columns to src/lib/database/schema/addtable.sql



Add any database tables / columns to file location: src/lib/database/schema/addtable.sql, can to see if the table is already inside the file location: src/lib/database/schema/schemaReference.sql file first
