TO DO:

Continue flow with job number 55

make sure the "ALLOCATE PARTS" part section always shows the customer request (at the top) and VHC request (blow the cusomter request) at all times if its been reported, now remove the requests from that sectin even if a part has been allocated to that request.

tighten the fallback labels ("Reported request" / "VHC authorised item") to pull more specific text from linked rows when available.

only show the “Parts” tab within the jobcards/myjobs/[jobnumber] page if the VHC is set to not required, if the “Parts” tab is hidden show the VHC tab, if the “Parts” is shown hide the VHC tab.

Within in that page, remove the “Daniel Hughes • GK19YHF • VAUXHALL” section below the “Job #00055” section. Change the “Job #00055” section to just “00055” for example

Add a new tab called “Documents” this is a mirror of the documents tab within the jobnumber/[jobnumber] page

Add the “00055” section into a section which is the same design as within the “ Updated 13 Feb at 10:25 Clock Out Complete Job (locked)” section but seperate from that section

What background card does “Fault” and “Rectification” sections sit in within the write up tab? Can we make that background card NOT THE ACUTATL CARD WHERE THE “Fault” and “Rectification” TEXT ARE WITHIN UT THE ONE BEHIND IT TO MATCH THE BACKGROUND OF THE FIRST CARD COLOUR

What about deleting that card?

Link the “JOB TYPE” section to the ai job type detection to the database so when the job detection is found within the create page so it all links to show the found job type

Make sure that changes everywhere where used job type like this

I need to move the “WARRANTY EXTRAS” button into a better location within the write up tab as well as “WRITE-UP” button within the  “WARRANTY EXTRAS” section, find a good place to put these buttons, have it so it only ahows when warrenty jobcard

Remove the “Requests” bubble and text



HERE
have it so only one active clocking status at once per user, example if a user forgets to clock out have it so they are auto clocked out at 12am every morning if the clocking is still active and have it if they log in, this creates a new clcoking adding the clock out time to the time before they clocked in to the new one. for refece this section is within the /profile page within the "Attendance History" section but make sure it updates within the database as well. 
 


FIND OUT yes work on this 
Can we add an auto detect text box locations, tick box location, signature box location, correct orientation, so the app can turn the uploaded document into a live seach which can be ticked, signed, reg field etc auto filled out. or is this not possible. 


DO THISSSS
work on implementing "AI" within whole app search chat "AI job detection system"



make sure the "ALLOCATE PARTS" part section always shows the customer request (at the top) and VHC request (blow the cusomter request) at all times if its been reported, now remove the requests from that sectin even if a part has been allocated to that request.


Fix it so when i click allocated with an authoirse request it works the same with a normal request. 



Within write up and VHC tab inside the tab section, when the VHC is fully complete (Everything is authorised or delcined) change the background colour to green, and when everything is ticked within the write up section change the write up tab button background to green as well. so the part moves to on job to within the row of the request its been allocated to, link this though the database as well. 

CHECK
Sub-job number, make sure database table update and is all linked. 

add the changes to the database into the addtables.sql for me to put into the table editor. 





CHECKKKK
have it so when in smaller screen than the full windows and full ipad size the sidebar open button and status open button are only shown at the top of the page in a 50/50 tab button style layout. add a close button on the "My Dashboard" row. 

CHECKKK
have it so the top bar doesnt show anythe mode or Welcome back section when in this modesand have it so the search bar isnt insdie the top bar its underneath the navigator and status button taking up the whole width. 




Go though each page and set which section has what level of colour level 1-4,  
Change to base layer " /* Level 3 (Bottom layer - pale red): page background + outer shell */
  --layer-section-level-3: #ffeaea;" adjust in all places where users 









TO BE COMPLETED AT END:

Go through the status of each section and job to make sure status is good and matchs and works well within the database. 




With every page within the top bar to the right of the search add a "?" button which opens a drop down (link to drop down style api) which shows (contact support (this opens messages tab and starts a new message with the uers Lead tech (add this in small print within the section as a todo) which within the text box to send the message shows a / comand which tells the sender the page the user was on and then the user can then input text after either reporting a concern, bug, or a question. The next in the drop down is a "Tutorial" button which gives multiple steps describing what each section and button does inside an overlay type style making the background darker and the section or button the tutorial is telling how to use lighter with the description box like a bubble which is inside the darker section and the bubble is following the light and dark theme, there is also a "Next" and "back" button which flicks through the each section and button to do with that page/the tab selected at the time of the button press with also an "Finish" button which closes the overlay and tutorial section. What woul dbe the best way to implement this? as an api with a file linked to each page and tab which has all of the buttons and section anmes and descriptions inside the api linking or a section within the actual code which reads the code and sees what section does what same with buttons, unless theres another way which is commonly used for tutorials like im describing.

NOTE:


See if database strucure links to all of the code with the src/lib/database/schema/schemaReference.sql also see if any tables are in the src/lib/database/schema/schemaReference.sql and are not being used inside the code and why they arent being used. Make sure that all of the code and inputes saves to the database where required and in the corrected locations add any tables/columns to src/lib/database/schema/addtable.sql



Add any database tables / columns to file location: src/lib/database/schema/addtable.sql, can to see if the table is already inside the file location: src/lib/database/schema/schemaReference.sql file first
