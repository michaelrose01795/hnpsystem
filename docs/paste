Brake Modal Enhancement - Complete Requirements

I need to modify the Brakes and Hub modal in my vehicle inspection system with the following requirements:

1. Drum Brakes vs Disc Brakes - Mutually Exclusive
Requirement: For the rear axle, drum brakes should replace BOTH brake pads AND brake discs (not just discs, not alongside them).

When drum brakes are selected, hide the entire rear pads section and rear discs section - show ONLY the drum brakes section
When disc brakes are selected, completely ignore any drum brake data
When drum brakes are selected, completely ignore any disc/pad data from the rear axle
Add a "Switch to Drum Brakes" button in the rear disc section
Add a "Switch to Disc Brakes" button in the drum section
2. Drum Brake Status Options
Requirement: Simplify the drum brake workflow with three clear options:

Good - Maps to Green status
Monitor - Automatically maps to Amber status (no additional severity selection needed)
Replace - Maps to Red status
Remove the "Not checked" option entirely
3. Brake Diagram Display
Requirement: Update the brake diagram to show drum brake status:

When drum brakes are selected, display the text "drum" in the rear brake positions (instead of pad measurements)
Color code the drum display:
Green if "Good" is selected
Amber if "Monitor" is selected
Red if "Replace" is selected
4. Input Focus Fix
Requirement: Fix the measurement input fields so users can type complete numbers without losing focus:

When typing "13", the user should be able to type "1" then "3" without the input field losing focus
Currently, typing "1" triggers a state update that removes focus, requiring the user to click back into the field to type "3"
Batch state updates for pad measurements to prevent this issue
5. Data Persistence and Validation
Requirement: Implement smart data handling for drum vs disc selection:

When drum brakes are selected:

Do NOT save rear pads or rear discs data to the database
BUT preserve the data in component state (in memory) so if the user accidentally switches to drums, they can switch back without losing their work
When disc brakes are selected:

Do NOT save drum brake data to the database
BUT preserve drum data in component state for switching back
6. Complete Button Logic
Requirement: Dynamic completion validation based on brake type:

For disc brake mode (rear discs selected):

Require: Front pads filled + Front discs filled + Rear pads filled + Rear discs filled
Complete button is active when all four sections are completed
For drum brake mode (rear drums selected):

Require: Front pads filled + Front discs filled + Rear drums status selected
Complete button is active when all three sections are completed
Rear pads/discs completion status is IGNORED
Switching behavior:

If rear pads/discs are filled out and complete button is active
User clicks "Switch to Drum Brakes"
Complete button should immediately become INACTIVE
Complete button stays inactive until drum brake status is selected
7. Concern Functionality
Requirement: All brake status buttons (Good, Monitor, Replace) should integrate with the existing concern system:

Users can add concerns for any brake component
Concerns should use the same modal/workflow as other sections
Concerns should escalate severity appropriately
