TO DO:

Continue flow with job number 54
Ware indicator not showing wihtin summary page isnide VHC tab, fix this so the ware indicator is showing in text inside the correct rows details. use the database if needed. 


within the "/vhc/customer-preview/[jobnumber]" page use the app light and dark theme within this page as well as using the logo light and dark in the top left and the details further along to the right. the page is still not linked to the database/showing the same items as the the summary page, treat the summary tab within the VHC tab inside the job-cards/[jobnumber] page as the hub for the authorised and declinded sections, do a deep dive to amke sure the correct rows are showing within the "/vhc/customer-preview/[jobnumber]" have it so its linked to the master datbase table which stores all of the rows and status etc. 


Remeber this is a preview of what the customer will see to make sure everything is correct. 

update the copy link button to copy the link to the clip board which will be the actual page the customer will see however for external users, this wont require a login to see this page and will only show the detauls of the summary like the Customer view so nothing can be changed or corrected, only viewed. have it so the link is something like /job-card/[jobnumber]/[linkcode (unique number and letters)] (or along those lines, this is for if the cust or user wants to send the report to someone else to check through they dont ave to log in and everything, it has an expiry of 24 hours and after that it generates a new link code). have it so the customer preview 

have it so the "Customer View" button is names "Cutomer Preview", have it so the that opens a new page, this new page doesnt have a sidebar/topbar within it. (it has a back button in the top right which takes the user back to the summary tab within the job-card/[jobnumber] page). as well this it shows all of the red reports, and then amber reports, and then at the bottom all of the green reports. have it so its layed out for the customer viewing with total prices, tick boxes for authorise or delicne (linked to the summmary authorise and delicne section) as well as showing a summary tab which shows the red amber and green with totals, a photo tab which shows all of the photos linked to the job number, and a video tab which shows all of the videos linked to the job number as well




Add a tab section inside the create page, this tab creates a new job card and the new tab will show the same contents within the first page tab, the only thing which carries over is the customer name and reg. 

have it so inside the appointment page the row are in the same row but new rows inside the same row. Within the page where the current requests are show inside the job card pages have it so more tabs are shown there with the main jobnumber and then the linked on with the tab which just changes to the new job card. 
uses a same prime job number example 00055 and then the sub job number would be for tab one 00055 and then the sub job number for the other tabs created will be 00056, 00057 etc. so the prime job number is used or dispalying the jobs togther wtihin the appointment page inside the todays work, and the same with assigning to techs, assepting in, same VHC,. and the sub job number will be used front end forshowing the job number in the pages, clocking onto indivdual jobs numbers.
Figure it out FO ONE STEP DONT FULL PASTE



have it so when hocer over the "STATUS" circule within the sumary tab, the hover section is the width of the text and follows the light and dark theme. 


have it so when in smaller screen than the full windows and full ipad size the sidebar open button and status open button are only shown at the top of the page in a 50/50 tab button style layout. add a close button on the "My Dashboard" row. 

have it so the top bar doesnt show anythe mode or Welcome back section when in this modesand have it so the search bar isnt insdie the top bar its underneath the navigator and status button taking up the whole width. 



Go though each page and set which section has what level of colour level 1-4,  
Change to base layer " /* Level 3 (Bottom layer - pale red): page background + outer shell */
  --layer-section-level-3: #ffeaea;" adjust in all places where users 





TO BE COMPLETED AT END:

Go through the status of each section and job to make sure status is good and matchs and works well within the database. 




With every page within the top bar to the right of the search add a "?" button which opens a drop down (link to drop down style api) which shows (contact support (this opens messages tab and starts a new message with the uers Lead tech (add this in small print within the section as a todo) which within the text box to send the message shows a / comand which tells the sender the page the user was on and then the user can then input text after either reporting a concern, bug, or a question. The next in the drop down is a "Tutorial" button which gives multiple steps describing what each section and button does inside an overlay type style making the background darker and the section or button the tutorial is telling how to use lighter with the description box like a bubble which is inside the darker section and the bubble is following the light and dark theme, there is also a "Next" and "back" button which flicks through the each section and button to do with that page/the tab selected at the time of the button press with also an "Finish" button which closes the overlay and tutorial section. What woul dbe the best way to implement this? as an api with a file linked to each page and tab which has all of the buttons and section anmes and descriptions inside the api linking or a section within the actual code which reads the code and sees what section does what same with buttons, unless theres another way which is commonly used for tutorials like im describing.

NOTE:


See if database strucure links to all of the code with the src/lib/database/schema/schemaReference.sql also see if any tables are in the src/lib/database/schema/schemaReference.sql and are not being used inside the code and why they arent being used. Make sure that all of the code and inputes saves to the database where required and in the corrected locations add any tables/columns to src/lib/database/schema/addtable.sql



Add any database tables / columns to file location: src/lib/database/schema/addtable.sql, can to see if the table is already inside the file location: src/lib/database/schema/schemaReference.sql file first
