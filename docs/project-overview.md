# Humphries & Parks Dealer Management System (DMS)

## Overview
The Humphries & Parks Dealer Management System (hnpsystem) is a cloud-based platform designed to unify all dealership operations into a single, paper-free system. It serves departments such as Accounts, Admin, Car Sales, Buying Cars, Managers, Workshop, MOT, Valeting, Painting, and Parts. The system replaces paper job cards, MPC checklists, and service sheets for Mitsubishi, Suzuki, and SsangYong vehicles.

It integrates the existing Navigation (used for workshop clocking times) and Auto Stock (used for car movement tracking) applications into one seamless solution.

## Core Goals
- Centralize all dealership operations into one cloud-based platform.
- Eliminate paper processes by digitizing job cards and checklists.
- Integrate existing systems (Navigation and Auto Stock).
